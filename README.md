Bullets
=======

Bullets is a free WordPress skeleton theme. It contains just about enough Sass to get you started on your next project - but without being a highly comprehensive frame work such as Foundation or Bootstrap.

If you need a frame work with all the bells and whistles - Bullets is not the tool for you. There are no carousels, no complex variations to serve every possible need.

If you find yourself removing 80% of what comes with a frame work - give Bullets a try.

### Basic Docs

- Get started by tweaking the settings in settings.scss
- You can remove or add the mixins in the style.scss file to only include what you need.
- Bullets has a 12 column grid with column classes for mobile, tablet and desktop, with the breakpoints of these controllable seperate to your media queries (though using the mqs by default).

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Run `npm update --save-dev` to update package.json dependencies to the latest and download the latest node modules.
- Run `gulp` to confirm everything is working

### Contribute

If you want to contribute - feel free. All pull requests considered. However, the aim of Bullets is to be light weight and skinny, so feature requests will always bare this in mind.
